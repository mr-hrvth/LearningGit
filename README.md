# LearningGit
Create scenarios to better understand the workings of git

## Scenarios

### Simulate two developers using the same branch

## Two developers using their own branch
We always create two branches from the original, do some changes and merge them back to original branch

### Change only new branches non conflicting way
We add/change/remove different lines

### Change only new branches conflicting way
We add/change/remove the same lines with different content

### Change original branch as well non conflicting way

#### Before changes in new branches

#### After changes in new branches

#### Somewhere during the changes in the new branches
